# travel-Liaison
Project 2 CRUD
<h1>Proposal</h1><hr>
<h2> Name and Description </h2>
<h2> travel Liaison </h2>
<p> This is a full stack application for Travel Agents to keep track of their clients information stored in clients profiles. It will allow agents to create, edit, update and delete clients profiles based on a variety of information necessary to book travel.</p>
<br>
<h2> Wireframes </h2>
<p>Included in wireframes folder</p>
<h2>User Stories</h2>
<p>Agents will be able to view all clients in database as well as create new ones. Also, the agent will have to option to delete and edit clients when necessary.</p><br>
<p> Clients will be able to perfrom CRUD functions and also view agents profiles. There will also be a page where clients can perform searches on travel, restaurants , and maps. The clients will then be able to attach comments that will be added to their profile for agents to plan clients travel plans.
<h2> Technologies used </h2>
<p> The technologies used in this project are Node.js, Express, Ejs, Javascript, SQL, and CSS. These techonologies will utilize the MVC model within the structure of the application. Some other features I would like to include is for clients to be able to perform CRUD on their profiles as well as a page where an API comes in to help clients research travel. Another feature that I would like to implement is a way to have multiple agents that would have their own database of clients accesible through a login feature.<p>
<h2> Database structure </h2>
<p> My databases are going to include a client database as well as an agent database. I will also have a database which can keep track of which clients belong to each agent.</p>
